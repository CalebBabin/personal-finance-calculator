# Personal Finance Calulator [[link](https://money.opl.io)]

Tired of having to maintain that one spreadsheet? Need help assisting less technical relatives and friends in figuring out the same information but without having to teach them how to use Google Sheets? This project might be for you!

## Getting Started

This is a React and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
